/**
 This is not 100% our code.
 We extracted the packing algorithm from MaxRectsBinPack.h
 in the repo:
 https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack/
 In the survey, it was found that this is packing algorithm was the fastest.
 
 The author of the code seems fine with assigning MIT license to the code:
 https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack/issues/18#issuecomment-460626460
 So this code is thus effectivelly considered to be under the MIT-license.
 
 Note, that we did some modifications to the original code.
 The biggest one being that we replaced all ints by floats.
 The original code did all packing on integer coordinates.

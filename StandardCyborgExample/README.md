## Getting Started
This repo depends on Standard Cyborg's Cocoapods: StandardCyborgFusion and StandardCyborgUI. You'll need to have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) set up first. You'll also need to have Git and Xcode installed. As well as a device with TrueDepth/FaceID camera.


```
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:StandardCyborg/StandardCyborgCocoa.git
cd StandardCyborgCocoa/StandardCyborgExample

# install pods
pod install

# open the workspace
open StandardCyborgExample.xcworkspace

# Build and run on your device. Running on the simulator won't work.
```
